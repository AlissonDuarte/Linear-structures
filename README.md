# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental data structures: Stack, Queue, and Deque. The implementations follow basic principles of data structures and are intended to provide both educational and practical references.

## Contents

1. **Stack:**
    -Implementation of an expression validator using the LIFO principle.
   - Operations: Push (insert), Pop (remove), Peek (view the top), and Check if it's empty.

2. **Queue:**
   - Implementation of a queue following the First In, First Out (FIFO) policy.
   - Operations: Enqueue (insert), Dequeue (remove), Peek (view the front), and Check if it's empty.

3. **Deque:**
   - Implementation of a deque (double-ended queue), allowing operations at both the front and rear.
   - Operations: Insert at the front, Insert at the rear, Remove from the front, Remove from the rear, Peek at the front, Peek at the rear, and Check if it's empty.

## Explanatory Article

For a deeper theoretical understanding and a detailed analysis of the implementations, please refer to the associated article: [Data Structures in Python: Stacks, Queues, and Deques (link)](link_to_your_article).

## How to Use

Each data structure is implemented in its respective Python file (`stack.py`, `c_queue.py`, and `deque.py`). To use, simply import the file relevant to your code.
